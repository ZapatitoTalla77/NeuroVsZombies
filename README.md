# NeuroVsZombies
A Neuro-Sama integration, letting her play PvZ using python 

## Presentation 
Hi, it's my first time doing something like this so this maybe take a while. I open to anyone who want to help me with code o textures.

The Mod feature textures, animations, custom audio, text (name of the plants and biography) and the ability for Neuro to play on her own.

*The mod its still a WIP*
## Installation 
* Python 3
```bash
pip install pymem
```
* CoolCat467 [Neuro Api](https://github.com/CoolCat467/Neuro-API/)
* Move the Main.pak to the PvZ directory (Where the .exe is) 

## Usage 
This mod and the accompanying Python code are only usable with PvZ Version 1.0.0.1051. Other versions are not supported (for example, the GOTY edition changes memory addresses dynamically every time it runs).

Moving the Main.pak only change the textures, animations, audio and text. The python script is the neuro integration 

## Feedback 
Like i said before its my first work with python and coding and my art its not very good, so any help are welcome. 
(Please add developer notes to keep an order in the script 🙏)
